## Happy Thougts

This was a learning exercise based on React tutorials.  Each js file is an expanded version of the previous one, so referencing the simplified version is easy.  

## To Run the Files

Change the script tag on the index page to reference the correct js file (happy.js to happy4.js) and then run 'ruby server.rb'.  The page should be available on localhost: 3000.
